# MBedwarsHotbarManager

### What is MBedwarsHotbarManager?
The MBedwarsHotbarManager addon allows users 
to select preferred slots for items to go 
when purchasing from the shop. It includes
a custom GUI, which can be accessed via a 
command, or through the MBedwars Shop (as of
now only in the HypixelV2 shop layout). 
Hotbar data is stored with MBedwars, meaning
it will work across a bungee server assuming
you are using MySQL.

### How do I install this addon?
Simply download the latest release, add it to
your MBedwars addons folder, and restart! No
setup is required other than that. The config
file will be generated in the addons folder
as well. 

## NOTE: Requires MBedwars v5.0.13
